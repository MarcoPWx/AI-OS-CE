# Storybook and Docs Decisions (CSF vs MDX, Web vs RN)

Purpose
Record the decisions and conventions for how we document components and flows using Storybook (web and RN), CSF stories, MDX docs, MSW, and testing.

Summary of decisions

- Use both CSF and MDX
  - CSF (.stories.tsx) is the source of truth for executable examples, interactions (play functions), Chromatic visual tests, and RN on-device stories.
  - MDX (.mdx) is for narrative documentation that stitches multiple CSF stories together (guides, overviews, how-to). MDX is web-only.
- Web Storybook is the docs portal
  - Web Storybook renders MDX (Docs tab/Autodocs), supports MSW, Swagger UI, toolbars, interactions, and Chromatic.
  - RN on-device Storybook is a developer playground (no MDX). Include short CSF descriptions so the same stories are informative in web Docs.
- Where files live
  - CSF: co-locate with components (src/components/_/_.stories.tsx); flows under src/stories/.
  - MDX: stories/\*.mdx for narrative pages. Reference CSF stories via <Canvas>.
- Platform strategy
  - Prefer shared stories rendered via react-native-web alias in web Storybook.
  - For native-only components (camera/sensors), either disable the story in web Chromatic/Docs or render a placeholder with a link to RN on-device instructions.
- Toolbar globals
  - WS Scenario toolbar: implemented (lobbyBasic, matchHappyPath, disconnectRecovery, taskBoardLive).
  - Theme toolbar: implemented (light/dark) with a decorator applying tokens.
  - Platform toolbar (cosmetic): implemented; controls tokens/styles to preview iOS/Android flavors without platform APIs.
- Testing strategy
  - Interaction tests: write at least one play() per key component/flow.
  - Visual regression: Chromatic on web stories; mark native-only or animated/flaky stories with chromatic.disable when needed.
  - E2E (Storybook): keep a small suite to validate flows, API Playground triggers, and Swagger.
- MSW usage
  - Base handlers in src/mocks/handlers.ts.
  - Storybook-only handlers in src/mocks/handlers.storybook.ts for demo endpoints (e.g., /api/tooltips/generate with TRIGGER\_\* behaviors).
  - Per-story MSW overrides via parameters.msw for targeted success/500/timeout states.
- Definition of Done (DoD) for a story
  - States covered: default, loading, empty/disabled, error, success.
  - Args wired to Controls with sensible defaults.
  - One play() for primary user action.
  - Optional per-story MSW overrides for error/timeout.
  - parameters.docs.description filled with usage/context.
  - Deterministic output (animations settled) for Chromatic.
  - Renders in RN on-device (or explicitly documented as web-only and disabled in Chromatic).

What we have now

- Web Storybook (Vite) with:
  - MSW (base + Storybook-only handlers), API Playground, Swagger UI.
  - WS Scenario toolbar; mockWebSocket reads window.**WS_MOCK_SCENARIO**.
  - Storybook Test Runner (Playwright) + workflow.
  - Chromatic workflow (add CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN secret).
  - Live/TaskBoard demo (taskBoardLive scenario).
- RN on-device Storybook:
  - Core sample stories and co-located component stories.
  - Flow stories for Auth/Home/Quiz/Results (CSF).

Whatâ€™s next (approved)

- Add theme toolbar + decorator (light/dark) in web Storybook.
- Add platform toolbar (cosmetic tokens) if helpful to product/design.
- Create MDX docs pages:
  - Mocking & Scenarios (links to API Playground, Live/TaskBoard, repo docs).
  - How to add/maintain stories (checklist + DoD).
- Expand LessonCard coverage (loading, locked, premium, error) and add a play().
- Add per-story MSW overrides to demo error states for critical UI (e.g., 500/timeout).
- Tag native-only stories as chromatic.disable when snapshots are noisy.

Conventions and naming

- Titles: Components/Button, Components/LessonCard, Layout/Header, Screens/Auth, Flows/Quiz.
- Story names: Default, Loading, Error, Empty, Disabled, Success (add domain names when needed).
- File paths:
  - Component stories: src/components/<Name>/<Name>.stories.tsx
  - Flow stories: src/stories/Flows/<Flow>.stories.tsx
  - MDX docs: stories/<Topic>.mdx

Cross-linking guidance

- Repo docs (docs/\*.md) contain conceptual guides and status.
- Web Storybook (MDX + Docs) contains living, interactive documentation; link to it from repo docs when appropriate.
- Avoid duplicating long-form content between repo docs and MDX; put conceptual material in repo docs and reference CSF stories from MDX pages for live examples.
