# QuizMentor System Status

## 2025-08-25: Enhanced Quiz Optimization System v2.0

### Overview

Implemented a sophisticated adaptive learning engine with ML-inspired algorithms, comprehensive testing, and advanced gamification mechanics. The system now provides personalized learning experiences that adapt in real-time to user performance.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Adaptive Learning Engine (`adaptiveLearningEngine.ts`)

- **Multi-Strategy Question Selection**: Combines 5 different selection strategies:
  - Spaced Repetition (30% weight) - SM-2 algorithm for optimal review timing
  - Knowledge Gap Targeting (25% weight) - Focuses on weak areas
  - Difficulty Curve Optimization (20% weight) - Maintains flow state
  - Learning Style Matching (15% weight) - Visual, verbal, logical, kinesthetic
  - Novel Question Exploration (10% weight) - Introduces new content

- **Flow State Optimization**:
  - Questions ordered for optimal engagement curve
  - Warm-up → Build confidence → Peak challenge (70% mark) → Cool down
  - Target 75% success rate for maximum engagement

- **Personalization Features**:
  - Adapts to 4 learning styles dynamically
  - Personalized hints based on dominant learning style
  - Skill level tracking using Elo-like rating system
  - Knowledge map with topic-level mastery tracking

- **Dynamic Reward System**:
  - Combo bonuses: 3x, 5x, 7x, 10x streaks
  - Time-based multipliers (fast: 1.5x, normal: 1x, slow: 0.7x)
  - Accuracy bonuses (perfect: 1000XP, excellent: 500XP, good: 200XP)
  - Streak multipliers compound up to 10 levels

#### 2. Session Configuration

| Type      | Questions | Mistakes  | Features                  | Use Case         |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Casual    | 5         | Unlimited | Hearts, Hints, No timer   | Quick practice   |
| Standard  | 7         | 3         | Hints, Timer optional     | Regular learning |
| Challenge | 10        | 2         | Timer, Power-ups          | Test skills      |
| Mastery   | 15        | 0         | All features, Competitive | Expert mode      |

#### 3. Anti-Frustration Mechanics

- **Comeback System**: Easier questions after 2+ consecutive failures
- **Encouragement Messages**: Contextual motivation after struggles
- **Redemption Questions**: Marked easier questions for confidence building
- **Skip Tokens**: Advanced users can skip 1 question per session
- **Progressive Hints**: 3-tier hint system (free → stars → premium)

#### 4. Cognitive Load Management

- Max 3 new concepts per session (Miller's Law)
- Working memory limit of 7±2 items
- Average processing time: 15 seconds per complex question
- Attention span decay factor: 0.95 over time

### Database Schema Updates Required

```sql
-- User learning profiles table
CREATE TABLE user_learning_profiles (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  category_id UUID,
  skill_level DECIMAL(3,2),
  overall_mastery DECIMAL(3,2),
  current_streak INTEGER,
  seen_questions TEXT[],
  knowledge_map JSONB,
  learning_style JSONB,
  performance_history JSONB,
  last_session_date TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User question history for spaced repetition
CREATE TABLE user_question_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  question_id UUID,
  category_id UUID,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP,
  easiness_factor DECIMAL(3,2),
  interval INTEGER,
  next_review TIMESTAMP,
  times_seen INTEGER,
  times_correct INTEGER
);
```

### API Endpoints Needed

- `POST /api/quiz/optimal-session` - Generate optimized quiz session
- `PUT /api/user/learning-model` - Update user learning model
- `GET /api/user/progress/:categoryId` - Get category progress
- `GET /api/analytics/performance` - Get performance analytics

### Next Steps for Implementation

1. Create UI components with proper data-testid attributes
2. Implement state management for learning models
3. Set up database tables and migrations
4. Create API endpoints for backend integration
5. Add real-time analytics dashboard
6. Implement A/B testing framework
7. Add telemetry for algorithm performance monitoring
