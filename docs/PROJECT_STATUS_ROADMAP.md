## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

1. **S2S Orchestration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple event bus, iterate
2. **Real-time Infrastructure**
   - Mitigation: Use managed services (Pusher/Ably) initially

3. **Gamification Balance**
   - Mitigation: A/B test engagement mechanics

### Medium Priority Risks

1. **Performance at Scale**
   - Mitigation: Load testing, caching strategy

2. **User Adoption**
   - Mitigation: Beta testing, iterative improvements

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed

1. **Infrastructure Provider**
   - AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure
   - Managed vs self-hosted services

2. **Real-time Technology**
   - Socket.io vs WebRTC vs managed service

3. **Database Strategy**
   - PostgreSQL + Redis vs MongoDB
   - Sharding strategy for scale

4. **Monetization Model**
   - Freemium vs ads vs subscription
   - Virtual currency implementation
