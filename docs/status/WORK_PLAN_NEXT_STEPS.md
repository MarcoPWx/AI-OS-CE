# QuizMentor - Strategic Work Plan

_Generated: 2025-08-29_
_Based on: Complete Epic Status Analysis_

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

With 72% overall completion and 2 epics fully done, QuizMentor needs focused execution on critical blockers. The main risk is the Backend epic at only 40% - this blocks production deployment.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Path Analysis

### Immediate Blockers (Must Fix Now)

1. **Backend/API (40%)** - Blocking production
2. **Testing/Jest Issues (70%)** - Blocking quality gates
3. **Security Headers (80%)** - Security vulnerability

### Dependencies Map

```
Backend (40%) â†’ Analytics (35%) â†’ Production (20%)
     â†“
Testing (70%) â†’ Quality Gates â†’ App Store
     â†“
Security (80%) â†’ Audit Compliance
```
