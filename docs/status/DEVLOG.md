# Development Log

## 2025-08-30
### Context
- update and lets see where we are now
- Next optional improvements (implemented now)
- •  agent:validate script
- •  Storybook Agent badge linking to Agent Boot with docs freshness
- •  Boot manifest + generator (agent:sync) to keep Agent Boot doc and page in sync


## 2025-08-30

### Decision: EPIC-12 Simplify Agent Boot & Docs (Ultra-minimal)
- Keep only two Agent actions:
  - update docs: updates DevLog, Epics, System Status (no extra side-effects)
  - load agent boot: regenerate AGENT_BOOT.md only when asked
- Planned removals: Storybook Agent badge, agent:validate, prestorybook auto agent:sync
- Planned keeps: docs:updates, manual agent:sync, canonical pointers (no content loss)

### Test infrastructure stabilization

- RN/Expo mocks added: Dimensions, PixelRatio, Reanimated, NetInfo, Notifications
- MSW Jest compatibility via moduleNameMapper and shared server fallback
- Supabase test stubs enhanced to support deep chains with .single()
- AnalyticsService test adapter implemented for legacy suites
- Axios mocking aligned to use global axios instance
- Next: finish NetInfo-dependent suites and evaluate perf suite limits

### Mobile Mock Beta Pivot (2025-08-30)

Decision
- Pivot to Mobile Mock Beta for on-device UI iteration (iOS + Android), no real backend.
- Goal: Build confidence in UX and flows with full mocks and rich console logs (dev builds), before wiring real services.

Acceptance criteria
•  Build: EAS builds install and run on-device with only mock services.
•  UX: Core quiz loop is stable; visuals consistent with theme tokens; mock banner visible.
•  Privacy: Store content and app privacy/data safety complete; no secrets; no PII.
•  QA: Smoke path passes on both iOS and Android.
•  Docs: DevLog/System Status updated to reflect Mobile Mock Beta pivot and readiness.

Plan
1) Mock-only gating for device builds (no real network)
2) EAS dev/preview profiles for iOS/Android (logs enabled)
3) In-app Demo/Mock banner overlay
4) Device smoke path checklist (launch → home → category → quiz → results)

ETA: 3–5 days to first on-device dev/preview builds with mocks.

Labs coverage added (2025-08-30)
- Added Labs/Mobile Mock Beta — how to run full-mock device builds and verify banner/logs
- Added Labs/S2S Orchestration — contracts, MSW, API Playground, Swagger, supertest
- Added Labs/User Journeys — coverage checklist and links to demos
Current Labs baseline (non-exhaustive)
- Technology Overview Lab, Mocking & Scenarios, Latency Profiles, Service Catalog, Data Events, Journeys Detailed, Quiz Flows, System Status Full
Gaps to consider next
- Performance budgets & device metrics lab; Security headers & audit lab; A11y lab for key screens

### BETA Readiness Assessment (2025-08-30)

Scope definition (Beta)
- Platform: Web (primary). Mobile (EAS preview) optional after web Beta.
- Core Loop: Start quiz → answer → feedback → results; offline fallback OK.
- Accounts: GitHub OAuth + email; minimal Profile; session persistence.
- Data: Supabase-backed questions/categories; analytics events persisted server-side.
- Quality: Unit tests stable for RN/Expo; smoke E2E for critical flows; Storybook docs consistent.
- UX: Consistent theme tokens; no hardcoded styles on epic screens; acceptable performance.
- Security: Basic headers and input validation; RLS/guards on critical endpoints; no secrets in logs.

Remaining work (gated by critical path)
1) Supabase Auth wiring (P0)
   - Configure redirects/env; implement GitHub/email sign-in/out; persist session; guard protected endpoints.
   - MSW fallback for Storybook/tests.
2) RN/Expo unit test environment (P1)
   - Harden mocks (Dimensions, PixelRatio, Reanimated, NetInfo, Notifications, socket.io-client); stabilize Jest config.
3) Analytics persistence (P1)
   - POST /api/analytics/event schema + insert; MSW + contract tests; client enqueue/flush with retry.
4) Back API stubs with Supabase (P1)
   - Quiz categories/questions (+ pagination); users profile CRUD; supertest + OpenAPI; minimal RLS/guards.
5) Theme propagation (P1)
   - Replace remaining hardcoded styles with tokens; Storybook light/dark checks.

Non-blocking but recommended for Beta polish
- Error handling pass with user-facing messages; logging structured without PII.
- Basic privacy/terms links; consent copy for telemetry if required.
- Performance sanity: lazy load heavy assets; verify initial load time.

Risks & mitigations
- Jest/Expo brittleness → Mitigate with explicit mocks and transform tuning; quarantine flaky suites with @flaky + TODO.
- OAuth callback complexity → Start with web GitHub; verify local redirect; document env setup.
- Schema drift → Lock minimal schema v1 and add supertest contract to prevent regressions.

Estimated timeline (web Beta)
- P0 Auth wiring: 1–2 days
- Test env stabilization: 1–2 days (in parallel)
- Analytics endpoint + client wiring: 1 day
- Supabase-backed API for quiz/users: 2–3 days
- Theme propagation and polish: 1 day
- Smoke E2E + docs tidy-up: 1 day
≈ 7–10 days total, assuming normal focus and no major blockers.

Acceptance criteria for Beta
- Auth: end-to-end GitHub/email; session persists; protected routes enforce JWT.
- Data: quiz fetch and profile CRUD live via Supabase; offline fallback remains.
- Analytics: events stored; contract tests green.
- Quality: unit tests green locally/CI; smoke E2E for core loop; Storybook pages render canonical docs.
- UX: themed screens; no hardcoded styles; acceptable perf.

### Public Beta Readiness Analysis (2025-08-31)

Gaps to address (mobile public beta)
1) Store accounts & credentials
   - Apple Developer and Google Play Console access ready.
   - EAS credentials configured (App Store Connect + Play service account). Current eas.json has placeholders.
2) Store listings & policies
   - Screenshots, app description, keywords, categories, age rating.
   - Privacy Policy URL (repo currently lacks a privacy policy doc); ToS exists.
   - App Privacy (Apple) and Data Safety (Google) forms — recommend “Data not collected” for mock beta.
3) Permissions hygiene
   - app.json/app.config.js currently request camera, microphone, location, notifications, tracking transparency.
   - For public beta (no real backend, no such features), prune to minimal (INTERNET/VIBRATE) to avoid rejections and simplify App Privacy/Data Safety.
4) In-app disclosures
   - Keep a Beta banner switch (env-driven) to indicate mock/demo status; disable for public testers if preferred.
5) Stability & QA
   - Run device smoke on a small matrix (iPhone + Android midrange) and log issues.
6) Accessibility & performance
   - Basic a11y checks on key screens; capture device launch time and first interaction.
7) Versioning & tracks
   - Confirm version/build numbers and choose TestFlight/GPlay track (internal/closed beta or public link where relevant).
8) Legal & support
   - Add Privacy Policy doc; add in-app links to ToS/Privacy; add support contact.

Recommended next actions
- Prune unused permissions/plugins from app.json and app.config.js for beta.
- Add docs/legal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md and wire links in app.
- Fill App Privacy/Data Safety forms; prepare store listing copy and screenshots.
- Configure EAS credentials (out of repo); target preview/internal tracks first.
