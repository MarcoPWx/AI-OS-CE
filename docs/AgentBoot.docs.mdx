# Agent Boot Contract - Reference Implementation

## Purpose
- This document makes the project "agent-ready." It defines the minimum I need to operate instantly, the guardrails I must follow, and how we collaborate via TDD and clean code practices.
- **REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION**: Not just a utility, but a complete learning platform with production-ready patterns that are educational by design.

## Constraints & Allowed Tools
- Terminal only; no external web browsing.
- Non-interactive commands; avoid pagers; prefer --no-pager or non-paged output.
- No secrets printed. Use env var names only (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY) and never echo values.
- Destructive actions (delete/migrate/overwrite) require explicit consent.

## Canonical Docs (single source of truth)
- DevLog: docs/status/DEVLOG.md
- Epics: docs/roadmap/EPICS.md
- System Status: docs/SYSTEM_STATUS.md

## Core Commands
- Dev server: npm run dev or npm run dev:mock
- Storybook: npm run storybook
- Build: npm run build
- Unit tests: npm test
- E2E tests: npm run test:e2e (smokes: npm run test:smoke:e2e)
- Lint: npm run lint (fix: npm run lint:fix)
- Format: npm run format

## Agent Operations (how to ask)
- Analyze: “Agent, read the Agent Boot page and canonical docs; propose top 5 priorities with TDD steps.”
- Update docs: “Agent, update DevLog/System Status/Epics from this session.”
- TDD feature: “Agent, implement `feature` via TDD: write failing tests, make it pass, refactor, update docs.”
- Refactor: “Agent, refactor `area` without changing external behavior; update tests/docs.”

## Update Flow (agent-driven)
- When you say “Update docs now”:
  - docs/status/DEVLOG.md: append a new dated entry with your session notes.
  - docs/SYSTEM_STATUS.md: set the “Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD” line.
  - docs/roadmap/EPICS.md: set or refresh the “> Updated: YYYY-MM-DD” line.
  - docs/status/last-updated.json: refresh timestamps. No UI badges are shown.
- When you say “Load Agent Boot”:
  - Ensure AGENT_BOOT.md and docs/AgentBoot.docs.mdx reflect this contract.
  - No manifests or pre-hooks; it’s manual-only.

- When you say “update” or “Update docs now”, I will update:
  - docs/status/DEVLOG.md (append a new dated entry)
  - docs/SYSTEM_STATUS.md (set “Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD”)
  - docs/roadmap/EPICS.md (set “> Updated: YYYY-MM-DD”)
  - docs/status/last-updated.json (refresh timestamps)

## TDD Policy
- Red-Green-Refactor:
  1) Write or adjust a failing test (Given/When/Then); commit.
  2) Implement the minimal change to pass; commit.
  3) Refactor for clarity/performance; keep green; commit.
- Coverage criteria: 80% min for lines, branches, functions, statements. Fails under thresholds.
- Flaky tests: mark @flaky, file a TODO with issue/ref, fix or quarantine with justification.

## Clean Code Guidelines
- Keep functions short and single-purpose. Extract helpers for clarity.
- Favor pure functions; isolate side-effects (I/O, network, time, randomness) behind interfaces.
- Explicit errors: differentiate user vs system errors; never swallow exceptions silently.
- Naming: intent-revealing names; consistent casing; no abbreviations that hide meaning.
- Comments: explain why, not what; keep code self-explanatory.
- Logging: structured key-value logs; no secrets; include correlation IDs if available.
- Config: env-driven; sane defaults; validate at startup.

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit: deterministic, stable selectors/IDs; no real network; mock time/random.
- Integration: limited scope; MSW for HTTP; assert contracts (shape/status).
- E2E: smokes for critical flows; avoid brittle selectors; control timing with explicit waits.
- Accessibility: run axe checks on key pages/components where feasible.

## Storybook Authoring Rules
- MDX v3 constraints: imports/exports only at top; put state inside React.use*.
- Canonicalization: DevLog/Epics/System Status stories load only the canonical doc paths.
- Link each story to related epics/tests (where useful).

## Security & Compliance
- BYOK: keys reside in memory only; never persisted.
- Content-Security-Policy: keep connect-src restricted to allowed domains.
- Data handling: no PII in logs; redact sensitive content in errors.

## Risk Gates (ask before proceeding)
- Deleting files, DB migrations, rewriting large swaths of tests, or changing public API shapes.
- Running commands that could disrupt local state (docker prune, rm -rf, etc.).

## Change Request Mini-DSL (optional)
- Scope: feature | fix | refactor | docs
- Context: `short business/tech context`
- Acceptance: `Given/When/Then`
- Constraints: `perf, a11y, API, deps`
- Touch: `paths/areas`
- Risk: low | medium | high

## Code Review Checklist (self-check)
- Does a failing test precede the change? Are tests minimal but meaningful?
- Are names clear? Any dead code or duplicate logic left?
- Are errors surfaced with actionable messages? No secret leakage?
- Is the change small and scoped? Could it be split further?
- Are docs updated (DevLog/System Status/Epics)?

## Boot Prompts (copy/paste)
- Analyze: “Agent: Read Agent Boot and canonical docs; propose a 5-item TDD plan.”
- Update docs: “Agent: Update DevLog/System Status/Epics from this session.”
- Implement: “Agent: Implement `feature` via TDD. Start with tests; minimal code; then docs.”

## Directory Orientation (example)
- App pages/API: src/app/**/*
- Components: src/components/**/*
- Docs: docs/**/* (canonical docs above)
- Stories: src/stories/**/*
- Tests: src/components/**/*/__tests__ and tests/e2e/**/*

## Reference Implementation Principles

### 1. Complete Learning Platform
- **User Journeys**: Complete business logic, not fragments
  - Onboarding: Multi-step wizards with preference management
  - Progress Journey: Analytics and data visualization
  - Each journey teaches real patterns

### 2. Teaching Through Patterns
- **MSW Integration**: Each endpoint has educational purpose
  - CRUD operations with optimistic updates
  - Stateful operations with proper state machines
  - Real-time operations with WebSocket patterns
  - Error scenarios with graceful degradation

### 3. Dev Tools as Real Platform
- **Epic Manager**: Actual project management, not a demo
- **System Status**: Live monitoring with real metrics
- **API Playground**: Postman alternative in-browser
- **Network Inspector**: DevTools alternative for learning

### 4. Interactive Labs
- **Security Lab**: Test attacks safely, learn defenses
- **A11y Lab**: Test accessibility, understand WCAG
- **Performance Lab**: Learn optimization through measurement

### 5. Implementation Standards

#### Every Feature Must Be COMPLETE
- No partial implementations
- Full error handling with recovery
- Proper state management (Redux/Context/Zustand patterns)
- Real patterns used in production

#### Educational Value is PRIMARY
- Code teaches best practices through example
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT
- Examples are production-ready, not toy demos
- Patterns are industry-standard, not academic

#### Testing is CORE
- TDD is mandatory for all features
- E2E tests for all user journeys
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Coverage thresholds enforced (80% minimum)

#### Performance MATTERS
- Optimize from the start, not later
- Lazy loading for code splitting
- Memoization for expensive operations
- Caching strategies built-in
- Performance budgets enforced

## Agent Boot Python Implementation

The `agent_boot.py` file demonstrates these principles:

```python
# Initialize the agent system
python agent_boot.py init

# Update documentation
python agent_boot.py update-docs --content "Session summary"

# Create an epic with validation
python agent_boot.py create-epic --title "New Feature" --description "Complete implementation"

# Test security patterns
python agent_boot.py test-security --input "<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Generate performance report
python agent_boot.py performance-report
```

### Key Components:

1. **AgentContext**: Single source of truth for state
2. **DocumentationManager**: Treats docs as code
3. **EpicManager**: Real project management with CRUD
4. **SecurityLab**: Safe security testing environment
5. **PerformanceMonitor**: Built-in performance tracking

## Acceptance Criteria for This Contract
- One canonical doc each for DevLog, Epics, System Status.
- Storybook boot page present and linked from top-level nav.
- Agent operates via TDD, updates docs on request, and respects guardrails.
- Reference implementation demonstrates all principles.
- Every component is complete, educational, tested, and performant.
