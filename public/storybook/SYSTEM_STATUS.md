# System Status

Last Updated: 2025-08-31

## Validation Record

- Last validated: 2025-08-29T10:02:30Z
- Checklist
  - [x] Storybook builds locally (build-storybook)
  - [x] Storybook Test Runner passes (test:stories)
  - [ ] Chromatic visual regression (optional)

Current Status
Overall: Yellow — Core loop stable after quiz fix; authentication not yet wired end-to-end.
Platform: Expo React Native (web + mobile dev). Offline-first fallbacks in place.

Service Status

- Frontend: Stable with professional theme; quiz navigation white screen fixed
- Authentication: Not fully wired — Supabase client configured via env; UI uses demo login
- Question Delivery: Online via Supabase when configured; offline fallback via local data
- Gamification: Hooks integrated; scoring/combos working
- Analytics: Client events structured; backend persistence pending
- Backend/API: Route stubs present; needs Supabase wiring + contract tests
- Database: Schema docs exist; migrations not verified in this environment
- Multiplayer: Mock services present; not on critical path
- Deployment: Dev only; not targeting stores yet

Progress Bars (realistic)

- Authentication & OAuth: ███░░░░░ 30%
- Gamification & Delivery: ███████░░ 75%
- Analytics & Tracking: █████░░░░ 50%
- API Foundation: ████░░░░░ 40%
- Database & Schema: █████░░░░ 50%
- Testing Infrastructure: ████░░░░░ 40% (RN/Expo mocks brittle)
- Theme/UI Consistency: ███████░░ 75%
- Documentation: ███████░░ 75% (now aligned to current truth)

Critical Path

1. Supabase Auth wiring (GitHub OAuth + email) — P0
2. Stabilize unit test environment for RN/Expo — P1
3. Persist analytics events to backend — P1
4. Back API stubs with Supabase + contract tests — P1
5. Theme propagation across Epic screens — P1

Recent Changes

- Fixed quiz white screen via safe fallbacks and guard UI
- Centralized Supabase usage in questionDelivery via src/lib/supabase
- Added docs/SETUP_ENV.md and scripts/dev-check.sh
- Created current sprint plan and designated docs/status/*_CURRENT.md as source of truth
- Integrated Storybook (web) with MSW, Swagger UI, WS scenario toolbar (incl. taskBoardLive), Chromatic, and Storybook Test Runner

Current Issues

- Jest environment brittle (TurboModules/Dimensions/expo-av)
- Auth not wired blocks personalization/persistence
- Some screens still use hardcoded colors/gradients
## Next Steps

- Implement Supabase auth (web + native callback handling where feasible)
- Refactor test-hostile components (e.g., module-scope Dimensions) and run unit tests green
- Implement analytics ingestion + contract tests
- Replace remaining hardcoded styles with theme tokens; validate in Storybook

## Mobile Mock Beta (Device UI iteration)

Definition (scope)
- On-device dev/preview builds (iOS + Android) with full mocks; no real backend.
- Stable core quiz loop; themed UI; visible mock banner; rich console logs.

Acceptance criteria
•  Build: EAS builds install and run on-device with only mock services.
•  UX: Core quiz loop is stable; visuals consistent with theme tokens; mock banner visible.
•  Privacy: Store content and app privacy/data safety complete; no secrets; no PII.
•  QA: Smoke path passes on both iOS and Android.
•  Docs: DevLog/System Status updated to reflect Mobile Mock Beta pivot and readiness.

Remaining Work
1) Mock-only gating for device builds (no real network)
2) EAS dev/preview profiles for iOS/Android (logs enabled; internal testing)
3) In-app Demo/Mock banner overlay
4) Device smoke path checklist (launch → home → category → quiz → results)

ETA
- Approximately 3–5 days to first on-device dev/preview builds with mocks.

## Public Beta (Mobile) — Gaps & Plan

Gaps
- Store accounts & EAS credentials: placeholders present; need real credentials (handled outside repo)
- Listings & policies: screenshots, description, privacy policy URL; App Privacy/Data Safety forms
- Permissions: prune camera/microphone/location/notifications/tracking if not used in beta
- Disclosures: beta/demo banner toggle; clarify mock status
- QA: device smoke on iOS/Android representative devices
- A11y & perf: basic checks and captured metrics

Plan
1) Prune permissions/plugins; keep minimal needed for mock beta
2) Add privacy policy doc; link from app
3) Prepare store listings and forms (data not collected)
4) Configure EAS credentials; build preview/internal; expand to public beta after smoke
