    <h2>Sample Questions</h2>

    <div class="question-card">
        <h3>In a production environment, you need to ensure that your AWS CloudFront distribution has the minimum amount of latency possible to serve static assets to users in Europe. Which of the following actions would you take to achieve this goal?</h3>
        <div class="option ">A. Implement a caching mechanism at the edge location closest to the user</div><div class="option correct">B. Use a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute the assets across multiple edges</div><div class="option ">C. Configure CloudFront to use a custom origin server for the European region</div><div class="option ">D. Optimize the HTTP headers and query strings to reduce the size of the requests</div>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To minimize latency when serving static assets to users in Europe, you should implement a caching mechanism at the edge location closest to the user. By doing so, the content will be stored in the cache and served from there, reducing the distance the content needs to travel and resulting in faster load times for users. Using a CDN or configuring CloudFront to use a custom origin server may also help reduce latency, but caching at the edge location is the most effective approach.</p>

        <h3>Write a C++ program to optimize the performance of a matrix multiplication algorithm by using a combination of loop unrolling, cache blocking, and parallel processing. Given a matrix size of 1024x768, what is the optimal running time in milliseconds for your solution?</h3>
        <div class="option ">A. Unroll the loops 4 times to reduce cache misses.</div><div class="option ">B. Use a block size of 128 to reduce memory accesses.</div><div class="option correct">C. Parallelize the multiplication process using OpenMP to exploit multiple CPU cores.</div><div class="option ">D. Implement a divide and conquer algorithm to reduce computational complexity.</div>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The optimal running time can be achieved by combining loop unrolling, cache blocking, and parallel processing. By unrolling the loops 4 times, we reduce the number of cache misses and improve performance. Additionally, using a block size of 128 reduces memory accesses and further improves performance. However, parallelizing the multiplication process using OpenMP is not the best approach as it can lead to race conditions and other issues. Implementing a divide and conquer algorithm may also be possible but would require more complex logic.</p>

        <h3>In a recent project, you are tasked with designing a scalable Java-based web application that needs to handle a large volume of traffic. Which of the following design decisions would you make to ensure optimal performance?</h3>
        <div class="option ">A. Implement a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.</div><div class="option correct">B. Use a content delivery network (CDN) to cache frequently accessed assets and reduce the load on the application server.</div><div class="option ">C. Design the application to use a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific functionality.</div><div class="option ">D. Optimize the application&#x27;s database queries by using a NoSQL database instead of a traditional relational database.</div>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> To ensure optimal performance in handling a large volume of traffic, it is best to implement a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This will allow the application to handle more requests simultaneously and reduce the risk of overloading any single server. Using a CDN to cache frequently accessed assets can also help reduce the load on the application server, but it may not be as effective in handling high traffic volumes as a load balancer. A microservices architecture can also provide scalability benefits, but it may add complexity and require more careful design and maintenance. Finally, using a NoSQL database can improve query performance, but it may not be as suitable for complex data models or transactions as a traditional relational database.</p>
