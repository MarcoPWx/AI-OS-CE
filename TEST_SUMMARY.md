# QuizMentor Test Summary

## 🎯 Current Status

Updated: 2025-08-30

- RN env stabilized (core mocks); several suites passing
- MSW mapping added; some ESM-reliant specs pending
- Supabase chain mocks added; adaptive engine chains now resolvable
- Heavy performance suite may require larger CI timeouts

### ✅ What's Working

1. **App is running successfully** on port 3003
2. **Home screen loads** with proper animations
3. **Demo user is displayed** correctly
4. **All UI components render** properly
5. **Basic unit tests pass** (simple.test.ts)
6. **E2E test framework** is set up with Playwright

### ⚠️ Issues to Fix

1. **Jest configuration** needs adjustment for React Native/Expo
2. **Service tests failing** due to async/await syntax issues
3. **Missing dependencies** in some service files
4. **Coverage threshold** not met (0% vs 50% target)

## 📊 Test Results

### Unit Tests

- ✅ **Simple tests**: 3/3 passing
- ❌ **Service tests**: 4/4 failing
- ❌ **Component tests**: Not run yet
- ❌ **Coverage**: 0% (target: 50%)

### E2E Tests

- ✅ **Framework**: Playwright configured
- ✅ **Basic navigation**: Working
- ⚠️ **Some navigation tests**: Failing due to app state

## 🔧 Issues Identified

### 1. Jest Configuration Issues

```bash
# Problems:
- "Unexpected reserved word 'await'" in gamification.ts
- "Cannot find module 'mixpanel-react-native'" in analytics
- "Easing.inOut is not a function" in animations.ts
```

### 2. Missing Dependencies

- `mixpanel-react-native` not installed
- Some Firebase packages missing
- React Native Easing not properly mocked

### 3. Syntax Issues

- Async/await in class methods not properly transpiled
- Some TypeScript syntax not handled by Jest

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Fix Jest configuration** for proper React Native support
2. **Install missing dependencies**
3. **Fix async/await syntax** in service files
4. **Update mocks** for better compatibility

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage
- **E2E Tests**: All critical user flows
- **Integration Tests**: API and service interactions
