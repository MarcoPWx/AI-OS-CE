# 🤖 AI-OS Developer Toolkit

Welcome to the **AI-OS Developer Toolkit** - your comprehensive guide and toolset for effective AI-assisted development.

## 🎯 Purpose

This Storybook serves as both a **learning platform** and **practical toolkit** for developers working with AI assistants like Claude, GPT-4, and GitHub Copilot. Learn best practices, understand workflows, and use real components that demonstrate effective patterns.

## What's Inside

This toolkit is organized into three main sections:

### 🤖 **AI Collaboration Guides**

### 🛠️ **Development Tools**

- **[Epic Manager](/story/epics-epic-manager-improved--default)** - Example of a production-ready component with full CRUD operations
- **[API Playground](/story/api-api-playground--default)** - Test API endpoints and understand request/response patterns
- **[Network Playground](/story/dev-network-playground--default)** - Monitor network performance and simulate load conditions

### 📊 **Monitoring & Logs**

- **[Status Dashboard](/story/status-statusdashboard--default)** - Real-time system health monitoring
