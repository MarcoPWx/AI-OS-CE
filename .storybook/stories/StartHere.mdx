Welcome! This is your guided entry point to learn the system, explore user flows, and try API endpoints right inside Storybook.

What you can do here

- Learn the stack and mocks: Docs/Tech Stack + API, Docs/Mocking & Scenarios
- Browse repo docs: Docs/Quick Index, Docs/Repo Docs Browser
- Explore user flows: Docs/ALL_USER_FLOWS.md (via Repo Docs Browser)
- Try APIs:
  - API/Playground (mocked endpoints, caching 304, rate limiting 429, error variants)
  - API/Swagger (OpenAPI spec with controls for doc expansion, model rendering, and TryOut)
- Observe realtime:
  - Live/TaskBoard (WebSocket mock with WS Scenario toolbar)
  - Live WS → SSE Fallback (Docs/Tech Stack + API page)
