How to use this page
- Use this as your live script. Each step links to the page you’ll present.
- Keep mock mode on for web demos (EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_MSW=1) and on-device builds (EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_ALL_MOCKS=1) when relevant.

Agenda (20–30 minutes)
1) Set the frame (2–3 min)
   - Start: Docs/00 Start Here → Quick Index
   - Purpose: what QuizMentor is; why mock-first; how Storybook drives dev and interviews

     - Quick Index: ?path=/story/docs-quick-index--page
2) Agent + Canonical Docs (2–3 min)
   - Agent Boot (guardrails and operating model): ?path=/story/docs-agent-boot--page
   - DevLog, Epics, System Status as single sources of truth
     - DevLog: ?path=/story/docs-dev-log--default
     - Epics: ?path=/story/docs-epics--default
     - System Status: ?path=/story/docs-system-status--default
3) Mobile Mock Beta (3–4 min)
   - Labs/Mobile Mock Beta: explain full-mock iteration and banner
   - Labs/Device Matrix: show the smoke checklist and exit criteria
   - Links:
     - Mobile Mock Beta: ?path=/story/labs-mobile-mock-beta--page
     - Device Matrix: ?path=/story/labs-device-matrix--page
4) Core functionality (6–8 min)
   - Auth & Session (mock flows, guards): ?path=/story/labs-auth-session--page
   - Quiz & Content (core loop + offline fallback): ?path=/story/labs-quiz-content--page

   - Leaderboard & Social (rankings, future hooks): ?path=/story/labs-leaderboard-social--page
   - Onboarding & Profile (first-run, basics): ?path=/story/labs-onboarding-profile--page
5) S2S and contracts (3–4 min)
   - Labs/S2S Orchestration: MSW, Api Playground, Swagger, supertest
   - Links:
     - S2S Orchestration: ?path=/story/labs-s2s-orchestration--page

     - Swagger: ?path=/story/api-swagger--default
6) Quality and guardrails (3–5 min)
   - Error & Offline lab: latency/error profiles, offline; logs without PII
     - ?path=/story/labs-error-offline--page
   - Performance & Device Metrics: code split checks and device sanity
     - ?path=/story/labs-performance-device-metrics--page
   - Security & Privacy: headers and data handling
     - ?path=/story/labs-security-privacy--page
   - Accessibility: key screens checks
     - ?path=/story/labs-accessibility--page
   - Sentry (optional): crash capture & release health, gated by env
     - ?path=/story/labs-sentry-crash-release-health--page
7) Close with status and roadmap (2–3 min)
   - System Status and Critical Path: ?path=/story/docs-system-status--default
   - Epics “Now Working On” summary: ?path=/story/docs-epics--default

Tips
- Narrate “why” before “how” for each step. Keep flows live and tangible.
- If asked about backend reality, pivot to S2S lab (contract-first) and describe migration from MSW to Supabase.
- If asked about crash fidelity, open the Sentry lab and explain the env-gated approach for interviews vs real builds.
