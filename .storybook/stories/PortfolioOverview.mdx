## Vision and Product Pillars

<a id="vision"></a>

Vision

- Make technical upskilling effortless, trustworthy, and engaging through a gamified, resilient learning experience.

Product pillars

- Trust‑first UX: clear states, recoverable errors, transparent status, consistent visuals.
- Learn‑by‑doing: interactive quizzes, instant feedback, lightweight multiplayer collaboration.
- Quality gates by default: interaction tests, a11y checks, visual regression, coverage thresholds.
- Open‑box DX: Storybook as a learning hub (API Playground, Swagger, Network demos, Docs browser).
- Resilience & Observability: cache/ETag, rate‑limit handling, status signals, observability events.

## Product Framing: Goals, Success, Non‑Goals, Assumptions

Goals

- Ship a resilient, fun learning experience that teaches quickly and builds trust
- Maximize Weekly Learning Progress (WLp): sessions completed, streak adherence, accuracy gains
- Provide a developer‑first platform for rapid iteration and safe changes

Success metrics

- Activation rate (onboarding → first quiz within N minutes) > 70%
- Quiz completion rate > 85%; median sessions/week > 3
- Docs learning engagement (Start Here and API Playground usage) trending upward week over week

Non‑goals (for now)

- Full content authoring CMS inside the app (use curated content/fixtures)
- Complex paywall + billing flows (keep demo/simple for interviews)
- Deep offline persistence beyond light caching

Assumptions

- Supabase is the target backend for Auth/Postgres/Realtime
- Storybook is our primary learning and demo surface
- MSW/WS scenarios sufficiently model expected networking behaviors during early phases

## Personas and System Context

## Service Inventory and I/O

<a id="service-inventory-io"></a>

This section enumerates what exists in this repository today and how to exercise it. Nothing listed here is hypothetical; it’s backed by code and/or stories in this project.

- HTTP mocks (MSW) — src/mocks/handlers.ts
  - Global controls
    - GET /**msw**/defaults → `{ latencyMs: number, errorRate: number }`
    - POST /**msw**/defaults `{ latencyMs?: number, errorRate?: number }` → same shape
    - Per-request opt-out header: x-msw-no-defaults: 1
  - Lessons
    - GET /api/lessons
    - In: optional headers (x-client-id, x-msw-no-defaults)
    - Out: 200 `{ lessons: [{ id, title, progress }] }`
  - Quizzes

  - Cache demo (ETag)
    - GET /api/cache with optional If-None-Match
    - Out: 200 `{ ts, value }` with ETag: "demo-etag-abc123" and Cache-Control: public, max-age=60; or 304 Not Modified with ETag
  - Rate limiting demo
    - GET /api/ratelimit
    - In: header x-client-id (default 'anon')
    - Window: 10s; Limit: 3
    - Out: 200 `{ ok, remaining }` with X-RateLimit-\* headers; or 429 `{ error: 'rate_limited' }` with Retry-After

- Tooltip generation mock — src/mocks/handlers.storybook.ts
  - POST /api/tooltips/generate `{ input: string }`
  - Special triggers inside input
    - TRIGGER_RATE_LIMIT → 429 with Retry-After: 3
    - TRIGGER_ERROR → 500 text/plain
    - TRIGGER_CACHED → 200 JSON with ETag: "tooltips-etag-v1"; subsequent call with If-None-Match returns 304
  - Default success: 200 `{ input, html }`
  - Honors x-msw-no-defaults to skip latency/error injection

- Supabase-style REST mocks — src/mocks/msw/handlers.ts
  - Auth
    - POST /auth/v1/token body grant_type=password → 200 `{ access_token, token_type, expires_in, refresh_token, user }`
    - POST /auth/v1/signup → 200 `{ user }`
