# Labs: Device Matrix — iOS/Android smoke and interview demo

import { Meta } from '@storybook/blocks';

<Meta title="Labs/Device Matrix" />

Purpose
- Run a fast, repeatable device matrix to de-risk crashes and showcase workflow in interviews.

Matrix (minimum viable)
- iPhone 13/14 (iOS 17.x)
- Pixel 6/7 (Android 13/14)
- Optional: low-end Android (Android 12) for perf sanity

Build flavor
- Dev/preview builds with mocks on-device
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_ALL_MOCKS=1
  - EXPO_PUBLIC_MOCK_BANNER=1
- Keep logs enabled (Xcode/Android Studio/Flipper)

Smoke scenarios (each device)
- Cold launch → Home → pick Category → 10 Q quiz → Results
- Airplane mode repeat (offline fallback)
- Theme spot check (light/dark)
- Background/resume during quiz
- Rotations (Android), notch/safe areas (iOS)
- Basic a11y: labels present on key controls

What to capture
- Time to first interaction (rough)
- Any jank/crash points and red screens
- Screenshots for store listing (portrait)
- Console warnings around transitions

Exit criteria
- No crashes, no unhandled rejections/red screens
- Smooth quiz loop; offline fallback works
- No obvious layout issues across device families

Interview talk track
- Start at Labs/Index → Labs/Mobile Mock Beta
- Explain mock gating, banner, and why we iterate UI first
- Walk the device smoke checklist live, narrate findings
- Close with Labs/S2S Orchestration to demonstrate contract-first thinking
